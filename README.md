# challenge-signoweb

## REASON
👨‍💻💻 This challenge was proposed by the company SignoWeb. I have to create a system following some requirements

> This is a poll system.

## DESCRIPTION

  Polls have three statuses: "*EM BREVE**", "*EM ANDAMENTO*" and "*ENCERRADA*". 

To vote and view the polls, you must be logged in. If you don't have an account, you need to create one.

 Once logged in, you have three options in the page header and the polls in the middle.
 
 You can create, edit and view polls created by you.
 This system prevents duplicate votes in a poll and has a live update of votes.
 
## BEFORE RUN

**RUN WITH MySQL**  this file:  **database\requirements.sql**
